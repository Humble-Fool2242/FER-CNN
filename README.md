Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

# Abstract:
Facial expression recognition is a topic of great
interest in most fields from artificial intelligence and gaming to
marketing and healthcare. The goal of this paper is to classify
images of human faces into one of seven basic emotions. A
number of different models were experimented with, including
decision trees and neural networks before arriving at a final
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs work better
for image recognition tasks since they are able to capture spacial
features of the inputs due to their large number of filters. The
proposed model consists of six convolutional layers, two max
pooling layers and two fully connected layers. Upon tuning of the
various hyperparameters.
